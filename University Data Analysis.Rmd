## Introduction

In this study, we intend to explore the different attributes of 4599 colleges and universities in 59 states.

![](university-vermont_279.png)

Through those data visualizations and analyses different insights are drawn regarding the school size, states, percent students with loans, percent female students, median earnings after 10 years, and so on. There we have explored that small school sizes have a higher median percent of students with loans than medium and large school sizes, while medium school sizes have the lowest. Female students are also higher at small schools than large schools. We can also observe that among top 10 states Vermont has the highest median percent of students with loans, Rhode Island has the second highest, and South Dakota has the third highest. We can also observe that among top 10 states Vermont has the highest median earnings after 10 years, Massachusetts the second, and Rhode Island the third. The final regression model output provides some interesting fact like the independent variables such as percent of students with loans, mean entry age, median family income, UGDS, admissions rate percent, and school size have statistically significant impact on median earnings after 10 years. Overall, percent of students with loans, admissions rate percent, and small school size have negative impact on median earnings after 10 years where mean entry age, median family income, and UGDS have positive impact on median earnings after 10 years.

## Data Cleaning

1.  Grouped the dataset by **School_size** to get the median **Percent of Students with Loans** and median **Percent of Female Students**. Next formatted the dataset from wide to long.

    ```{r}
    d1<-dt %>% 
      group_by(School_size) %>% 
      summarise(`Percent of Students with Loans`=median(Percent_students_with_loans,na.rm = T),
                `Percent of Female Students`=median(Percent_Female_students,na.rm=T)) %>% 
      gather(key = "Variable",value = "Values",-1)
    ```

2.  Grouped the dataset by **State_Name** to get the median **Percent of Students with Loans.** Next, sorted the dataset by median **Percent of Students with Loans** in descending order. Finally, selected top 10 observations from those.

    ```{r}
    d2<-dt %>% 
      group_by(State_Name) %>% 
      summarise(`Percent of Students with Loans`=round(median(Percent_students_with_loans,na.rm = T),2)) %>%
      arrange(desc(`Percent of Students with Loans`)) %>% 
      top_n(10)
    ```

3.  Grouped the dataset by **State_Name** to get the **Median Earnings After 10 Years.** Next, sorted the dataset by **Median Earnings After 10 Years** in descending order. Finally, selected top 10 observations from those.

    ```{r}
    d3<-dt %>% 
      group_by(State_Name) %>% 
      summarise(`Median Earnings After 10 Years`=round(median(Median_earnings_after_10yrs,na.rm = T),2)) %>%
      arrange(desc(`Median Earnings After 10 Years`)) %>% 
      top_n(10)
    ```

4.  Selected the numeric variables from the dataset for correlation matrix.

    ```{r}
    dt.n<-dt[,-c(1,2,10,11)]
    ```

5.  Created the correlation matrix considering pairwise missing removal.

    ```{r}
    dt.matrix <- cor(dt.n,use="pairwise.complete.obs")
    ```

## Data Visualizations

### Median Indicators by School Size

```{r,warning=F}
d1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=School_size,y=Values,group=Variable,fill=Variable))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",position = "dodge")+
  geom_text(aes(label=paste0(Values,"%")),position = position_dodge(width=1),hjust=-0.1,angle=90)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(value) paste0(value, "%"),breaks = seq(0,100,by=10),limits = c(0,100))+
  labs(x="School Size",y="Median",fill="Indicators")

```

From the above grouped bar chart, we can observe that the median percent of students with loans is comparatively higher for small school sizes compared to medium and large school sizes. Among all the school sizes, medium school sizes show the lowest median percent of students with loans.

Next, we observe that the median percent of female students is comparatively higher at small schools and comparatively lower at large schools.

### Top 10 States with Highest Median Percent of Students with Loans

```{r}
d2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=(reorder(State_Name,`Percent of Students with Loans`)),y=`Percent of Students with Loans`)) +
  geom_segment( aes(x=(reorder(State_Name,`Percent of Students with Loans`)), xend=(reorder(State_Name,`Percent of Students with Loans`)), y=0, yend=`Percent of Students with Loans`)) +
  geom_point( size=5, color="red", fill=alpha("orange", 0.3), alpha=0.7, shape=21, stroke=2) +
  geom_text(aes(label=paste0(`Percent of Students with Loans`,"%")),hjust=-0.3)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(value) paste0(value, "%"),breaks = seq(0,100,by=10),limits = c(0,110))+
  labs(y='Median Percent of Students with Loans',x='States')+
  coord_flip()

```

The above lolipop chart shows the top 10 states having highest median percent of students with loans among those 59 states. Here, we can see that the highest median percent of students with loans is observed for **Vermont** state. The second highest median percent of students with loans is observed for **Rhode Island** state. The third highest median percent of students with loans is observed for **South Dakota** state.

### Top 10 States with Highest Median Earnings After 10 Years

```{r}
d3 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=(reorder(State_Name,`Median Earnings After 10 Years`)),y=`Median Earnings After 10 Years`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",fill="blue4")+
  geom_text(aes(label=`Median Earnings After 10 Years`),hjust=-0.01)+
  ylim(0,62000)+
  labs(y='Median Earnings After 10 Years',x='States')+
  coord_flip()
```

The above bar chart shows the top 10 states having highest median earnings after 10 years among those 59 states. Here, we can see that the highest median earnings after 10 years is observed from **Vermont** state. The second highest median earnings after 10 years is observed from **Massachusetts** state. The third highest median earnings after 10 years is observed from **Rhode Island** state.

### Correlation Matrix among All the Numeric Attributes

```{r}
corrplot(dt.matrix, type="upper", tl.col="black")
```

The above correlation matrix showed the correlation between eight numeric variables in the dataset. Here, we can observe that **Percent_students_with_loans** is weakly positively related to **Percent_Female_students**, **Median_earnings_after_10yrs**, and **Median_family_income** (because the circles are showing blueish colors and the size of the circle is smaller) but negatively weakly related to **UGDS** and **Percent_Male_students** (because the circle is showing a redish color and the circle is smaller). Next, we can observe that the **Percent_Female_students** and **Percent_Male_students** are perfectly negatively related to each other (so, we can't use both of those variables together in the same linear model due to multicollinearity). Finally, we can observe that **Median_family_income** is moderately negatively related to **Mean_entry_age** but moderately positively related to **Median_earnings_after_10yrs**.

## Data Analyses

### Multiple Linear Regression Model 1

Here, the multiple linear regression model is created using **Median_earnings_after_10yrs** as dependent variable and **Percent_students_with_loans, Percent_Female_students, Mean_entry_age, Median_family_income, UGDS, Admissions_rate_percent,** and **School_size** as independent variables. Here, **UNITID, Institution_name,** and **State_Name** are not used for the model because those are nominal variables with too many unique observations and **Percent_Male_students** is not used because it is perfectly correlated to **Percent_Female_students**.

```{r}
options(scipen = 999)
model1<-lm(Median_earnings_after_10yrs~.-UNITID-Institution_name-State_Name-Percent_Male_students,data = dt)
summary(model1)
```

From the above regression output, we can say that the overall regression model is statistically significant as the p-value of F-statistic is less than 0.05. We can also observe that the value of Adjusted R-squared is 0.4973 which indicates that among total variations of **Median_earnings_after_10yrs**, 49.73% variations can be explained by **Percent_students_with_loans, Percent_Female_students, Mean_entry_age, Median_family_income, UGDS, Admissions_rate_percent,** and **School_size.**

Next, we can observe that the p-values of the regression coefficients are not all less than 0.05. Like the p-value of regression coefficient of **Percent_Female_students** is 0.056398 which is greater than 0.05. So, we can say that this predictor is not showing any statistically significant impact on **Median_earnings_after_10yrs** in the presence of other predictors**.**

### Multiple Linear Regression Model 2

Now, we can recreate the regression model in a backward step-wise approach to select only the statistically significant predictors.

```{r}
model2<-ols_step_backward_p(model1,prem = 0.05)
summary(model2$model)
```

The above model output is showing all the predictors' regression coefficients p-values are less than 0.05 which indicates that those existing predictors statistically significantly predict **Median_earnings_after_10yrs.** Now, we can see that the value of Adjusted R-squared is 0.4972 which indicates that among total variations of **Median_earnings_after_10yrs**, 49.72% variations can be explained by **Percent_students_with_loans, Mean_entry_age, Median_family_income, UGDS, Admissions_rate_percent,** and **School_size.**

Now, we can interpret the individual impact of **Percent_students_with_loans, Mean_entry_age, Median_family_income, UGDS, Admissions_rate_percent,** and **School_size** on **Median_earnings_after_10yrs.**

-   **Percent_students_with_loans:** The regression coefficient of **Percent_students_with_loans** is -76.58754 which indicates that for per unit increment of **Percent_students_with_loans**, the **Median_earnings_after_10yrs** will be decreased by 76.58754 units on average while considering all other variables constant.

-   **Mean_entry_age:** The regression coefficient of **Mean_entry_age** is 1108.56855 which indicates that for per unit increment of **Mean_entry_age**, the **Median_earnings_after_10yrs** will be increased by 1108.56855 units on average while considering all other variables constant.

-   **Median_family_income:** The regression coefficient of **Median_family_income** is 0.47928 which indicates that for per unit increment of **Median_family_income**, the **Median_earnings_after_10yrs** will be increased by 0.47928 units on average while considering all other variables constant.

-   **UGDS:** The regression coefficient of **UGDS** is 0.14045 which indicates that for per unit increment of **UGDS**, the **Median_earnings_after_10yrs** will be increased by 0.14045 units on average while considering all other variables constant.

-   **Admissions_rate_percent:** The regression coefficient of **Admissions_rate_percent** is -186.01146 which indicates that for per unit increment of **Admissions_rate_percent**, the **Median_earnings_after_10yrs** will be decreased by 186.01146 units on average while considering all other variables constant.

-   **School_size:** The regression coefficient of **School_sizeSmall** is -6495.67397 which indicates that if the **School_size is Small**, the **Median_earnings_after_10yrs** will be decreased by 6495.67397 units on average compared to **School_size Large** while considering all other variables constant.

## Conclusion

Based on data visualizations and analysis, small school sizes have a greater median % of students having loans than medium and large school sizes, while medium school sizes have the lowest. Female students are also more prevalent in small schools than in large institutions. Vermont has the highest median percent of students with debt among the top ten states, Rhode Island has the second highest, and South Dakota has the third highest. The final regression model output shows that all the predictors' regression coefficients p-values are less than 0.05, which indicates that those existing predictors statistically significantly predict Median_earnings_after_10yrs. The value of Adjusted R-squared is 0.4972, which indicates that among total variations of Median_earnings_after_10yrs, 49.72% variations can be explained by Percent_students_with_loans, Mean_entry_age, Median_family_income, UGDS, Admissions_rate_percent, and School_size. Overall, percent of students with loans, admissions rate percent, and small school size have negative impact on median earnings after 10 years where mean entry age, median family income, and UGDS have positive impact on median earnings after 10 years.
